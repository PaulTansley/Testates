\item{save}{Choose to save the output to disk}

\item{age_file}{The name of the optional age file to graph the results with}

\item{depth_start}{The first depth you sampled}

\item{depth_int}{The interval in cm between depths of each sample}

\item{boot_size}{The numbe of bootstrap cycles to run}

\item{x}{Name of your own data to apply the transfer function to}
